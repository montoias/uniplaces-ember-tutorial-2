# Tutorial 2

In this tutorial we talk about the model and ember-data.

We focused in the model and more specifically on adapters, serializers and relationships. We used ember-cli-mirage to mock the server behaviour and how we could use it to produce better tests.

In the end I demonstrated how easy it would to use Firebase. In this Repository it's not present how on purpose. If you have the time please follow https://github.com/firebase/emberfire#installation and try it out. :smile:

I recommend this as a supplementary read: https://emberigniter.com/fit-any-backend-into-ember-custom-adapters-serializers/
